🧩 Task 04 - Sudoku Solver

This project is part of the Prodigy Infotech Internship Program. The goal is to implement a Python-based Sudoku Solver that takes an unsolved puzzle as input and uses algorithms to solve it automatically.

📌 Project Description

This Sudoku Solver uses backtracking to fill in the missing numbers of a 9x9 Sudoku grid. The program reads an input grid where empty cells are represented by zeros, attempts to fill the board according to Sudoku rules, and displays the completed solution.

🎯 Features

- ✅ Automatically solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- 🔁 Uses backtracking algorithm to explore and validate possible number placements
- 🧠 Handles puzzles with multiple empty cells efficiently
- 📤 Accepts input as a 2D list/grid of integers
- 📄 Simple terminal-based output of the solved grid

 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3
- Key Concepts:
  - Backtracking Algorithm
  - Recursion
  - 2D Arrays (Lists)
  - Constraint Checking
